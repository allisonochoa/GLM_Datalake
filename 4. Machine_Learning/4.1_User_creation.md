# Oracle Machine Learning
**Oracle Machine Learning (OML)** is a suite of tools and capabilities that support data exploration, preparation, and machine learning (ML) modeling at scale using SQL, R, Python, REST, automated machine learning (AutoML), and no-code interfaces. All of these within Oracle Database and Autonomous Database.

## OML User Creation
Therefore, I created a specific user for accessing OML.

Once in my OCI account, I navigated to my ADW databases. I clicked on **DATALAKE_ADW** > *Database actions* > *View all database actions*.

This popped another window: the **ADW console**. In here, I clicked on *Administration* > *Manage users* > *Create new user*.

I then proceeded to creating the **OMLUSER 1** with the following specifications:
- **OML**: enabled.
- **Tablespace DATA cuota**: 500M

Also including a password.

## Accessing OML
With my **OMLUSER 1** created, I continued the process accessing to **OML**.

Inside the **ADW console** I clicked on *Menu* (the stacked bars â˜°)  > *Machine Learning* (external link):

This popped up the **OML** login screen, where I entered the credentials for the user I just created:

I had now accessed the **OML** home screen:
