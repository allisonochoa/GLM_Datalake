# Auth Token
In **OCI**, an **Auth Token** is a string generated by Oracle used for authenticating with third-parties (a password for these third-party services). They are associated with the user's console login, don't expire, and a user can have up to two at a time. 

In my case, I was going to use it while creating the credentials to access **Object Storage** objects later on in this project.


## Generating an Auth Token
In my OCI instance, I clicked on *User settings* > *Auth Tokens* > *Generate Token*. I provided a description and generated it.

## Creating DLUSER connection
I also created another connection specifically for the user **DLUSER**. Following this considerations:
- Using the password I established previously.
- Through my previously generated and downloaded client credentials wallet.
- Under the **myord_high** service.
