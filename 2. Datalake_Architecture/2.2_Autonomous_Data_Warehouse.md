# Autonomous Data Warehouse
**Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)** is a fully managed, cloud-based data warehousing service that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate administrative tasks and optimize performance (minimizing manual intervention). It's designed to handle large volumes of data and provide high-performance analytics for business intelligence and data-driven decision-making. 

See how I used it for the ML model creation:

## Database Creation
I logged into my OCI account *Navigation Menu* > *Oracle Databases* > *Autonomous Databases*, and created an Autonomous Database called **DATALAKE_ADW**.

## Database Provisioning
Once the status of the database was shown as *Active* , I clicked on the instance **DATALAKE_ADW** > *Database actions* > *View all database actions* > *Administration*, and established a password. At this moment I was able to download the **Client Credentials** (Wallet).

This was going to be useful later on when establishing a connection between ADW and the code editor.
