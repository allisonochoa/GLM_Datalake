# Object Storage
**Object Storage** is a computer data storage architecture designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data. For this project I used **OS** as part of the datalake architecture needed to create the prediction machine learning model. I followed these steps:

## Object Provisioning
I created the following buckets in OCI as shown:
1. **datacontent**
2. **dataflow-logs**
3. **dataflow-warehouse**
4. **DataLake_ObjectStorage**

*Note that their visibility should be established as **Public**.*

## Data Ingestion 
1. I opened the **DataLake_ObjectStorage** bucket and uploaded the following external (csv) files:
    - **channels.csv**
    - **customers.csv**
    - **products.csv**
    - **promotion.csv**
    - **sales.csv**
    - **supplementary_demographics**
    - **times.csv**

2. I opened the **datacontent** bucket and uploaded the following external (csv and sql) files:
    - **products.csv**
    - **sql_report_datalake.sql**
